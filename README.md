# Sarcasm

## What is this?

A small bot / application that makes things sArcAStiC.

## Why would you do this?

I'm a terrible person!

## How do I use this?

To 'translate' a phrase from a terminal:

```shell
    python3 sarcastic.py -phrase='test phrase'
```

To translate a file from a terminal:

```shell
    python3 sarcastic.py -file='The Art of War' -output='tHe aRT of WaR'
```

To run the bot, simply run `sarcasm-bot.py` and keep it running for as long as you want the bot active. You will need to set up a bot with your discord account, following the directions in discord's documentation.

Congratulations, now you are also a terrible person.
